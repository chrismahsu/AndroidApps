Historically, apps requested READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to ask users to grant access to Files & Media. Then, they implemented their own media picking experience, adding heavy development & maintenance costs to the developer team.In Android 13, we introduced a new visual media picking tool: the Android photo picker. This tool provides a way for users to select media files, without needing to grant access to their entire media library.

Account Manager This class provides access to a centralized registry of the user's online accounts. The user enters credentials (username and password) once per account, granting applications access to online resources with ""one-click"" approval.Different online services have different ways of handling accounts and authentication, so the account manager uses pluggable authenticator modules for different account types. Authenticators (which may be written by third parties) handle the actual details of validating account credentials and storing account information. For example, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft Exchange each have their own authenticator.
(ref:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager)
addAccount
Asks the user to add an account of a specified type. The authenticator for this account type processes this request with the appropriate user interface. If the user does elect to create a new account, the account name is returned.
NOTE: If targeting your app to work on API level 22 and before, MANAGE_ACCOUNTS permission is needed for those platforms. See docs for this function in API level 22.
Requires android.Manifest.permission.MANAGE_ACCOUNTS
addAccountExplicitly
Adds an account directly to the AccountManager. Normally used by sign-up wizards associated with authenticators, not directly by applications.
removeAccount
Removes an account from the AccountManager. Does nothing if the account does not exist. Does not delete the account from the server. The authenticator may have its own policies preventing account deletion, in which case the account will not be deleted.

Here are some common scenarios where an app may need the READ_PHONE_STATE permission:

Telephony-related apps: Apps that provide telephony-related features like call management, call recording, or caller ID functionality may request this permission to access the necessary telephony state information.

Communication apps: Some messaging or calling apps may require the READ_PHONE_STATE permission to determine the device's telephony state and adjust their behavior accordingly. For example, an app may need to know if a call is ongoing to properly handle incoming messages or notifications.

Device management apps: Certain device management or security apps may request this permission to access the phone's IMEI or IMSI for device identification or tracking purposes. These apps may also need telephony state information to enforce policies related to calls or cellular connectivity.

Network-related apps: Apps that utilize cellular network connectivity, such as signal strength measurement apps or apps that provide network-related statistics, may request this permission to access telephony state information."

VPN; privacy enhancement
VpnService is a base class for applications to extend and build their own VPN solutions. In general, it creates a virtual network interface, configures addresses and routing rules, and returns a file descriptor to the application. Each read from the descriptor retrieves an outgoing packet which was routed to the interface. Each write to the descriptor injects an incoming packet just like it was received from the interface
Services extending this class need to be declared with an appropriate permission and intent filter. Their access must be secured by Manifest.permission.BIND_VPN_SERVICE permission, and their intent filter must match SERVICE_INTERFACE action. Here is an example of declaring a VPN service in AndroidManifest.xml:
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/VpnService
To add a VPN service to your app, create an Android service inheriting from VpnService. Declare the VPN service in your app manifest file with the following additions:
Protect the service with the BIND_VPN_SERVICE permission so that only the system can bind to your service.
Advertise the service with the ""android.net.VpnService"" intent filter so that the system can find your service.

If an app wants to lock the screen using custom tap or swipe gestures, it typically requires the android.permission.MANAGE_DEVICE_ADMIN permission.

The android.permission.MANAGE_DEVICE_ADMIN permission is a system-level permission that allows an app to manage device administration features, including the ability to lock the screen, set password policies, and perform other device management tasks.

By requesting the MANAGE_DEVICE_ADMIN permission and becoming a registered device administrator, a security app can perform actions like remotely locking the device, enforcing security policies, and providing anti-theft features.

to create a new surface or to change the properties of a surface (Google-PaLM)

Apps that require the android.permission.ACCESS_SURFACE_FLINGER permission typically fall into the following categories:

1. Screen Recording Apps: Apps that record the device's screen, such as screencasting or game recording apps, require this permission to access the SurfaceFlinger service, which manages the composition and display of graphics on the screen. This permission allows these apps to capture the visual content being displayed on the screen and record it as a video.

2. Live Wallpaper Apps: Live wallpapers are animated or interactive wallpapers that run on the device's home screen. To function properly, live wallpaper apps need access to the SurfaceFlinger service to render and display their animations or interactive elements on the screen.

3. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Apps: VR and AR apps often require low-latency access to the display to provide immersive experiences. The android.permission.ACCESS_SURFACE_FLINGER permission allows these apps to bypass the normal graphics pipeline and directly interact with the SurfaceFlinger service, reducing latency and improving the overall VR/AR experience.

4. Screen Mirroring Apps: Apps that enable screen mirroring or casting to external displays, such as TVs or projectors, require this permission to access the SurfaceFlinger service and capture the device's screen content for mirroring purposes.

5. Accessibility Services: Some accessibility services may need this permission to modify the visual output of the device's screen, such as applying color filters or magnifications, to assist users with visual impairments.

It's important to note that this permission is considered a high-risk permission, as it allows an app to bypass the normal security mechanisms that protect the device's display."

ASEC (Android Secure External Cache) - implemented in a time when Android devices come with limited storage and has to resort to external storage (i.e. SD card) for apps, and its purpose is to securely store part of the apps so as to prevent corruption and piracy by copying SD card contents.
From Wikipedia: Applications moved to an SD card use an ASEC extension. These files can then be found under the .android_secure folder on the SD card. If an application must be moved from memory back to its device’s local storage, the file is decrypted from the ASEC file format to a basic APK (Android Package) file format.
To achieve ""Move to SD card"" feature.

"Bind to a service - means creating a connection between your application and a service that is running in the background. This allows your application to interact with the service and access its functionality. 
Once you have bound to a service, you can call its methods and access its fields. You can also receive callbacks from the service when its state changes.
Binding to a service is a powerful way to interact with background services in Android. However, it is important to note that binding to a service can be expensive in terms of performance. Therefore, you should only bind to a service when you need to access its functionality. (Google-PaLM)

When a client binds to a service, it creates a long-term association with the service, enabling ongoing interaction. This is typically done by calling the bindService() method, passing an Intent to specify the service to bind to. (ChatGPT)",,,,,,,,,
